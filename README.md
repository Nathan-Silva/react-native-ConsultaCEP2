# Consulta CEP - React Native

My first project in React Native.
When I was in college, I was challenged by a professor to consume a public API and display the result in a mobile Activity. The result is here :)

Basically, this app receives a post-code input and performs a GET Request on the website https://viacep.com.br/ returning address data.
